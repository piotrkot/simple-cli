[Object thinking by David West](http://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-Developer-Reference-David/dp/0735619654) is an amazing read.
Author convinces that proper object-oriented design, fundamentally different
from structured design, can leverage communication among all team members 
(with users included), contribute to vast product simplicity, produce
better developers.

While soft advantages are hard to question and prove, West mentions published
empirical metrics of Mark Lorenz and Jeff Kidd<sup>[1](#MarkKidd)</sup> which
he interprets as
> Lines of code, for example, in a well-thought-out object application will be
at least an order of magnitude fewer (sometimes two orders of magnitude).

Well, that's impressive. Let's look closer.
